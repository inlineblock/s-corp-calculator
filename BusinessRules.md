We are building a calculator website that allows you do determine if you should be using an S Corp or an LLC.

These are the business requirements:
 * The website should work with mobile devices
 * It should compare only single member LLC and S-Corp, which is also single member
 * You should be able to input your total income
 * There should be a slider for how much you set your salary, with the max being your total income
 * It should show your savings or costs of using an S Corp based on taxes
 * You should be able to select your state
 * The website should be ready for localization and translate into english, spanish, french, japanese, and Future RTL Language
 * It should be very modern and space ship looking
 * Components should be in their own files in components/ directory
 * Write tests for the business logic and components
